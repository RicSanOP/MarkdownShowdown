# Essential Commands and Training Techniques

## Summary
This note covers essential commands for managing notes and useful techniques for training machine learning models. It includes reminders on proper note formatting, such as the use of the `<info>` tag, and examples of chunk formats. Additionally, it documents training experiences and resolutions from project reports, including the use of learning rate schedulers, early stopping criteria, and gradient clipping to address issues like overfitting and convergence stability.

## Justification
The title 'Essential Commands and Training Techniques' was chosen because it encompasses the key topics covered in the provided markdown chunks: useful commands and techniques for training models. This title is concise yet descriptive, capturing the essence of the information to be included in the new note.

## Training Techniques
### Week 3 Report - How I Did
<info>
Note Path: Week 3 Report.md

#### How I Did:

- I used an initial learning rate of 1e-4, with weight decay to prevent overfitting. Based on training observations, I experimented with a **learning rate scheduler** and **early stopping criteria** to improve convergence stability.

### Week 3 Report - Problems

Note Path: Week 3 Report.md

#### Problems:

- Noticed that the model was converging too quickly, potentially overfitting to early stages of training, with validation performance plateauing.

### Week 3 Report - Resolution

#### Resolution:

- Lowered the learning rate and introduced **gradient clipping** to stabilize the training process. Early stopping was used to prevent overfitting. I also increased the number of training epochs to allow for more robust convergence.
