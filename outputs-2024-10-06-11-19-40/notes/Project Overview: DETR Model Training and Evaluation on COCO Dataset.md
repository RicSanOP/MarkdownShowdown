This title encompasses the breadth of the provided chunks, covering the preparation, training, evaluation, and troubleshooting of the DETR model on the COCO dataset. It highlights the comprehensive nature of the note, which includes various aspects of the project from data preparation to model training and evaluation.

## Data Preparation

### Downloading and Preprocessing COCO Dataset
- **Machine Learning Researcher:**
  - Downloaded and structured the COCO dataset for training.
  - Implemented basic data augmentation (random resizing, horizontal flips).
  - Next: Work on loading the dataset into the training pipeline.

### Data Augmentation and Preprocessing
- **George:**
  - Implemented data augmentation strategies (resizing, cropping, etc.).
  - Wrote code to load data via .

### Handling Annotations
- **Rifaat:**
  - Ensure the annotations are loaded in the correct format using COCO's method. COCO uses bounding boxes and segmentation masks, which are key for training DETR.

## Model Implementation

### DETR Model with ResNet Backbones
- **George:**
  - Implemented the DETR model with ResNet-50 backbone.
  - Fine-tuned the model architecture and integrated positional encoding.
  - Next: Begin training the model on COCO with different hyperparameters.

### Model Training
- **George:**
  - Began training with ResNet-50 and ResNet-101 models, monitoring loss and validation metrics.
  - Next: Experiment with learning rate adjustments and conduct performance evaluations with the COCO validation set.

### Hyperparameter Tuning
- **George:**
  - Experiment with hyperparameter tuning (learning rate, weight decay).
  - Monitor training progress, including loss curves and validation accuracy.

## Evaluation and Testing

### Performance Evaluation
- **George:**
  - Evaluate the trained models on the COCO validation set.
  - Benchmark DETR's performance (mAP, IoU) against other object detectors.

### Testing and Benchmarking
- **Rifaat:**
  - Conducted evaluation on the COCO validation set to calculate metrics such as mAP and IoU.
  - Started benchmarking DETRâ€™s performance against traditional models for comparison.

## Troubleshooting

### GPU Memory Limitations
- **Rifaat:**
  - The ResNet-101 model's higher memory requirements caused GPU memory limitations, especially when using larger batch sizes, resulting in out-of-memory errors during training.

### Exploding Gradients
- **Suhas:**
  - Debugged several training issues, including NaN values during backpropagation caused by exploding gradients, which I resolved through gradient clipping.
  - Implemented fixes for GPU memory limitations during ResNet-101 training, including reducing batch sizes and enabling gradient accumulation to simulate larger batch sizes.

## Dependency and Environment Management

### Initial Setup
- **Suhas:**
  - Ensured that all dependencies (e.g., PyTorch, torchvision, COCO API) were correctly installed and version-compatible.
  - Set up and managed the development environment using Conda, ensuring seamless setup across different platforms.

### Bug Tracking and Issue Resolution
- **Suhas:**
  - Debugged several training issues, including NaN values during backpropagation caused by exploding gradients, which I resolved through gradient clipping.
  - Implemented fixes for GPU memory limitations during ResNet-101 training, including reducing batch sizes and enabling gradient accumulation to simulate larger batch sizes.
