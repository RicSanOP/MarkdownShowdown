## Reflections

### Excitement for Future Phases
Iâ€™m excited to see how the final model will perform in real-world benchmarks and eager to dive deeper into **inference optimization** in the next phase of the project.

### Documentation and Collaboration
- Actively contributed to documenting code structure, especially around environment setup and performance improvements, ensuring that the project remains maintainable and accessible to team members.
- Worked closely with the **Machine Learning Researcher** to debug training issues and ensure that the model training ran smoothly, especially during hyperparameter tuning and fine-tuning stages.
