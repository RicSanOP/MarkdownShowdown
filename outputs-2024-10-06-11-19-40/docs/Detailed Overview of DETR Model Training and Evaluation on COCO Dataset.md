## Data Preparation for Training

### Tasks

- **Download COCO 2017 dataset (train and validation splits):**
  - Completed by George and Rifaat.

- **Preprocess and structure the dataset for model input:**
  - Completed by George and Rifaat.

- **Implement data augmentation strategies (resizing, cropping, etc.):**
  - Completed by George and Rifaat.

- **Write code to load data:**
  - Completed by George and Rifaat.

### Details

- **Dataset Structure:**
  - Images and annotations are separated into the following folders:
    - `train`: contains training images.
    - `val`: contains validation images.
    - `annotations`: contains JSON files with corresponding annotations.

- **Data Loading:**
  - Utilize `torchvision`'s COCO dataset wrapper for data loading.

- **Data Augmentation and Preprocessing:**
  - DETR uses random resizing and horizontal flipping for data augmentation during training.

- **Handling Annotations:**
  - Ensure the annotations are loaded in the correct format using COCO's method.

- **Class and Label Mapping:**
  - Map COCO’s 80 classes to the corresponding object classes in the DETR model.

### Issues and Resolutions

- **Version Compatibility Issues:**
  - Faced issues with the version compatibility between the COCO API and PyTorch, causing data loading errors.
  - Resolved by updating the file, adjusting the API versions for COCO and PyTorch, and running environment tests.

## Model Implementation

### Tasks

- **Review and understand the DETR architecture:**
  - Completed by George.

- **Fine-tune the model architecture for the dataset (ResNet-50, ResNet-101):**
  - Completed by George.

- **Implement positional encodings and object queries:**
  - Completed by George.

- **Set up the model for training on the COCO dataset:**
  - Completed by George.

## Model Training

### Tasks

- **Train DETR with ResNet-50 and ResNet-101 backbones on COCO:**
  - Completed by George and Rifaat.

- **Experiment with hyperparameter tuning (learning rate, weight decay):**
  - Completed by George and Rifaat.

- **Monitor training progress, including loss curves and validation accuracy:**
  - Completed by George and Rifaat.

- **Fine-tune the model using transfer learning from pretrained weights:**
  - Completed by Rifaat.

### Details

- **Training Progress:**
  - Began training with ResNet-50 and ResNet-101 models, monitoring loss and validation metrics.
  - Observed early convergence issues with ResNet-50; adjusted learning rate and decay.
  - Continued training on ResNet-101 and evaluated with the COCO validation set.

### Issues and Resolutions

- **NaN Values During Training:**
  - The model occasionally produced NaN values in the loss function during training, especially when using large learning rates.
  - Resolved by implementing gradient clipping to prevent the gradients from becoming too large and destabilizing the training process.

- **GPU Memory Limitations:**
  - The ResNet-101 model's higher memory requirements caused GPU memory limitations, especially when using larger batch sizes, resulting in out-of-memory errors during training.
  - Resolved by reducing batch sizes and enabling gradient accumulation to simulate larger batch sizes.

## Evaluation and Testing

### Tasks

- **Evaluate the trained models on COCO validation set:**
  - Completed by George and Rifaat.

- **Benchmark DETR's performance (mAP, IoU) against other object detectors:**
  - Partially completed by George and Rifaat.

- **Test model on additional evaluation datasets to check for generalization:**
  - Not completed.

- **Analyze false positives and negatives to improve model performance:**
  - Not completed.

### Details

- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - Conducted evaluation on the COCO validation set to calculate metrics such as mAP and IoU.
  - Started benchmarking DETR’s performance against traditional models for comparison.

- **Transfer Learning and Evaluation:**
  - Transferred the pretrained weights from the ResNet-50 model to the ResNet-101 backbone, leveraging transfer learning to accelerate training on the deeper architecture.
  - Used COCO's evaluation scripts to generate detailed precision-recall curves and IoU-based performance metrics.
