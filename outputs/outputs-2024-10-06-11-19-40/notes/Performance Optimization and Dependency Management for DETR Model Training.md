## Contents

### Week 1: Dependency Management
- **Software Engineer:**
  - Completed a review of the required dependencies.
  - Updated the file with PyTorch, torchvision, and other necessary libraries.
  - Next: Will set up the Conda environment and test installation on multiple platforms.

### Week 2: Initial GPU Performance and Memory Usage
- **Task: Optimizing GPU/CPU Usage**
  - As the project progressed, the focus shifted to monitoring GPU memory usage.
  - Noticed a significant slowdown in training speed, accompanied by memory allocation errors.
  - **Solution:** Optimized memory usage by experimenting with smaller batch sizes and enabling mixed precision training using PyTorch’s native AMP.

### Week 3: Debugging Data Loading Issues
- **Task: Efficient Data Loading**
  - Optimized data loading and pipeline efficiency.
  - Initially, data augmentation operations were applied on the CPU, slowing down the training loop.
  - **Solution:** Used multi-threaded data loading and moved preprocessing to the GPU, increasing the number of workers to parallelize data loading across multiple CPU cores.

### Week 4: Resolution of GPU Memory Issues
- **Resolution:**
  - Reduced the batch size to fit within the available GPU memory and used gradient accumulation to compensate for the smaller batch size.
  - Optimized the data loader to prefetch smaller batches efficiently to reduce overhead.

### Dependency Management
- **Conda Environment:** Recommended for creating isolated environments and managing Python dependencies.
- **Optional Dependencies:** Panoptic API required for panoptic segmentation tasks.
- **Dependency Updates:** Regularly check for updates to PyTorch, torchvision, and other packages to ensure compatibility. Maintain a file for version tracking.

### Performance Optimization
- **Monitoring Training Speed:** Identified performance bottlenecks and optimized GPU usage through batch size adjustments and multi-GPU setups.
- **Profiling Memory Usage:** Optimized data loading and memory usage for training.
- **Improving Inference Time:** Tweaked the Transformer layers to improve inference time.

### Challenges and Risks
- **Dataset Limitations:** Challenges related to dataset limitations.
- **Overfitting and Model Complexity:** Addressing overfitting and managing model complexity.
- **Infrastructure Limitations:** Managing infrastructure limitations, such as GPU availability.

### Resources and Budget
- **Hardware (GPUs), Datasets, Software:** Expected costs for infrastructure and training time.

### Introduction to Software Engineer
- **Programming:** Strong Python skills, particularly with frameworks like PyTorch and libraries such as NumPy.
- **Optimization:** Knowledge of performance tuning, GPU/CPU optimization, and memory management.

### Model Implementation and Optimization
- **Model Implementation:** Fine-tune or implement new Transformer-based models using DETR’s architecture.
- **Performance Optimization:** Monitor and optimize GPU/CPU usage, training speed, and model inference time.
- **Documentation and Code Review:** Oversee and review code quality, and ensure documentation for new features is clear.

### Importance of System Optimization
- In large-scale machine learning projects, system optimization is crucial.
- Handling GPU memory, data pipeline efficiency, and training stability are critical aspects that can make or break the success of a model's deployment in production.
