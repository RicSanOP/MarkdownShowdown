# Comprehensive PyTorch Reference for DETR Project

This note provides a comprehensive reference to PyTorch for the DETR project, covering essential concepts such as tensors, autograd, modules and models, optimizers, datasets and data loaders, training loops, GPU/CPU switching, and saving and loading models. It begins with an introduction to PyTorch and proceeds to explain each concept in detail, offering a thorough guide to leveraging PyTorch's capabilities for the project's deep learning components.

## Introduction to PyTorch Reference

Note Path: PyTorch Reference.md
Author: suhas

Here’s a condensed reference to **PyTorch** for working on the DETR project:

### 1. Tensors

* PyTorch’s core data structure is the **Tensor**, similar to NumPy arrays but optimized for GPUs.

### 2. Autograd

* PyTorch automatically computes gradients for backpropagation using **autograd**.

### 3. Modules & Models

* Models are created using the **class**. This is where layers and forward pass logic are defined.

### 4. Optimizers

* PyTorch provides optimizers like SGD, Adam, etc., for updating model parameters.

### 5. Datasets & DataLoaders

* The **class** is used to load datasets and handle batching.

### 6. Training Loop

* A typical PyTorch training loop includes:
  1. Forward pass
  2. Loss computation
  3. Backward pass
  4. Optimizer step

### 7. GPU/CPU Switching

* Models and data can be transferred between CPU and GPU using:

### 8. Saving and Loading Models

* Models are saved and loaded using **and**.
