# Model Training and Optimization Strategies

## Introduction

This note documents the training and optimization strategies employed during the project. It highlights the use of an initial learning rate of 1e-4 and the implementation of a learning rate scheduler and early stopping criteria to improve convergence stability. The note also addresses issues such as rapid convergence and potential overfitting, and details the resolutions employed, including lowering the learning rate, introducing gradient clipping, and increasing the number of training epochs to ensure more robust convergence.

## How I Did

- I used an initial learning rate of 1e-4, with weight decay to prevent overfitting. Based on training observations, I experimented with a **learning rate scheduler** and **early stopping criteria** to improve convergence stability.

## Problems

- Noticed that the model was converging too quickly, potentially overfitting to early stages of training, with validation performance plateauing.

## Resolution

- Lowered the learning rate and introduced **gradient clipping** to stabilize the training process. Early stopping was used to prevent overfitting. I also increased the number of training epochs to allow for more robust convergence.

## Justification

The title 'Model Training and Optimization Strategies' was chosen because the provided chunks primarily focus on the training process of machine learning models, including issues faced and strategies employed to optimize and stabilize the training. The chunks from 'Week 3 Report.md' discuss learning rates, schedulers, early stopping criteria, and gradient clipping, which are all key aspects of model training and optimization.

## Summary
