# Project Dependency Management and Optimization

## Summary
This note covers the comprehensive management and optimization of project dependencies. It includes discussions from meeting notes where the Software Engineer outlined the setup of the Conda environment, identified performance bottlenecks, and planned optimizations. Additionally, it details the review and update of required dependencies such as PyTorch and torchvision, the use of Conda for environment management, and the importance of keeping dependencies up-to-date. The note also mentions specialized tasks and the importance of maintaining a clear installation process for seamless collaboration.

## Justification
This title encompasses the main themes of the provided chunks, which focus on managing dependencies, optimizing software performance, and setting up the development environment. The chunks include discussions on dependency management, Conda environment setup, and performance optimization, all of which are essential for project documentation.

## Meeting Notes Week 2
- **Software Engineer:**
  - Successfully set up the Conda environment and verified dependency installations.
  - Identified some performance bottlenecks in GPU memory usage during initial tests.
  - Next: Optimize data loading and memory usage for training.

## Tasks and Dependency Management
**Dependency Management**
- Review the repository for required dependencies (PyTorch, torchvision).
- Verify compatibility of dependencies with latest versions.
- Update with necessary libraries and versions.
- Test environment setup (Conda, Docker) for seamless installation.

## Meeting Notes Week 1
- **Software Engineer:**
  - Completed a review of the required dependencies.
  - Updated the file with PyTorch, torchvision, and other necessary libraries.
  - Next: Will set up the Conda environment and test installation on multiple platforms.

## Managing Dependencies with Conda
2. **Managing Dependencies:**
   - **Conda environment**: Recommended for creating isolated environments and managing Python dependencies.
   - **Install Command**:

## Optional Dependencies for Specialized Tasks
3. **Optional Dependencies:**
   - **Panoptic API**: Required for panoptic segmentation tasks. Install with:

## Keeping Dependencies Up-to-Date
4. **Dependency Updates:**
   - Regularly check for updates to PyTorch, torchvision, and other packages to ensure compatibility.
   - Maintain a file for version tracking.

## Summary of Dependency Management
Managing dependencies with a clear installation process and environment management via Conda will minimize issues with mismatched versions and simplify collaboration.
