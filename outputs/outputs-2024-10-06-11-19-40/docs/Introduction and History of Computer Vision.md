# Introduction and History of Computer Vision

## What is Computer Vision?

Computer Vision is a subfield of Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence where humans teach computers to see and interpret the world around them. While humans and animals naturally solve vision as a problem from a very young age, helping machines interpret and perceive their surroundings via vision remains a largely unsolved problem. Limited perception of the human vision along with the infinitely varying scenery of our dynamic world is what makes Machine Vision complex at its core.

## History of Computer Vision

### Early Beginnings

- **1956**: "Artificial Intelligence"
- **1959**: Neuropsychology: Discover vision is hierarchical

### First Computer Vision Projects and AI Winter

- **1960s**: First computer vision project (MIT summer project)
- **1970s**: "AI winter"

### Early Advances in Neural Networks and Face Detection

- **1990s**: Rudimentary neural networks
- **2001**: Face detection (Viola & Jones)

### Major Breakthroughs in Computer Vision

- **2012**: AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al.)
- **2015**: [[CNN|ResNet]]

### Recent Developments in Computer Vision

- **2020**: [[DETR]] (Facebook)
