## PyTorch Reference
Here’s a condensed reference to **PyTorch** for working on the DETR project:

### 1. Tensors
- PyTorch’s core data structure is the **Tensor**, similar to NumPy arrays but optimized for GPUs.

### 2. Autograd
- PyTorch automatically computes gradients for backpropagation using **autograd**.

### 3. Modules & Models
- Models are created using the **class**. This is where layers and forward pass logic are defined.

### 4. Optimizers
- PyTorch provides optimizers like SGD, Adam, etc., for updating model parameters.

### 5. Datasets & DataLoaders
- The **class** is used to load datasets and handle batching.

### 6. Training Loop
- A typical PyTorch training loop includes:
  1. Forward pass
  2. Loss computation
  3. Backward pass
  4. Optimizer step

### 7. GPU/CPU Switching
- Models and data can be transferred between CPU and GPU using:

### 8. Saving and Loading Models
- Models are saved and loaded using **and**.
