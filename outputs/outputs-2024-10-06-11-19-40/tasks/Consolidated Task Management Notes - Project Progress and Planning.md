## COCO Dataset

The COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset is a large-scale image dataset designed for object detection, segmentation, keypoint detection, and captioning. It consists of over 200,000 labeled images and 80 object categories, with more than 1.5 million object instances. COCO is unique due to its focus on object detection in complex, cluttered scenes with multiple objects per image. The dataset also provides annotations for object segmentation, making it valuable for tasks like instance and panoptic segmentation. COCO is widely used for benchmarking machine learning models in object detection and segmentation.

## Data Preparation for COCO Dataset

### Data Preparation

1. **Dataset: COCO (Common Objects in Context)**
   - [[Detection Transformer Model Architecture]] (DETR) is primarily trained on the COCO dataset, which contains images with labeled objects for object detection tasks.
   - **COCO 2017 Dataset**: Download and unzip the train and validation splits. The dataset can be found [here](<https:>).

2. **Dataset Structure**:
   - Images and annotations are separated into the following folders:
     - : contains training images.
     - : contains validation images.
     - : contains JSON files with corresponding annotations.

3. **Data Loading**:
   - Utilize **torchvision’s COCO dataset wrapper** for data loading:
   - This will automatically parse COCO images and annotations into a usable format for training.

4. **Data Augmentation and Preprocessing**:
   - DETR uses **random resizing** and **horizontal flipping** for data augmentation during training. You can find the augmentations in the module.
   - Example of applying augmentations:

5. **Handling Annotations**:
   - Ensure the annotations are loaded in the correct format using COCO's method. COCO uses bounding boxes and segmentation masks, which are key for training DETR.

6. **Class and Label Mapping**:
   - Map COCO’s 80 classes to the corresponding object classes in the DETR model. This is handled automatically when using the.

## Week 4 Report

#### Evaluation and Benchmarking:

- Conducted **evaluation on the COCO validation set** to calculate metrics such as **mAP** and **IoU**.
- Started benchmarking DETR’s performance against traditional models for comparison.

#### How I Did:

- Transferred the pretrained weights from the ResNet-50 model to the ResNet-101 backbone, leveraging transfer learning to accelerate training on the deeper architecture.
- Used COCO's evaluation scripts to generate detailed **precision-recall curves** and **IoU-based performance** metrics.

#### Problems:

- The [[Convolutional Neural Network|ResNet-101]] model's higher memory requirements caused **GPU memory limitations**, especially when using larger batch sizes, resulting in out-of-memory errors during training.

#### Resolution:

- Reduced the batch size to fit within the available GPU memory and used **gradient accumulation** to compensate for the smaller batch size, maintaining training stability. Additionally, I optimized the data loader to prefetch smaller batches efficiently to reduce overhead.

## Project Reflections

While the architecture itself has been solid, managing the training process for a model of this complexity has involved overcoming several technical hurdles, particularly related to memory optimization and data handling.

### Importance of System Optimization

In retrospect, I’ve learned the importance of **system optimization** in large-scale machine learning projects. Handling **GPU memory**, **data pipeline efficiency**, and **training stability** are critical aspects that can easily be overlooked in the initial design phases but can make or break the success of a model's deployment in production.

### Excitement for Future Phases

I’m excited to see how the final model will perform in real-world benchmarks and eager to dive deeper into **inference optimization** in the next phase of the project.

## Devlog

### Week 1 - Initial Setup and Dependency Management

#### Task: Dependency Management and Environment Setup

In the first week, my primary focus was getting the development environment up and running. After reviewing the project dependencies, it became clear that the version compatibility between **PyTorch**, **torchvision**, and the **COCO API** might be a pain point. My initial task was to ensure that all dependencies were correctly installed and working seamlessly.

I encountered version issues with the **COCO API**, specifically when attempting to load the dataset. The error message indicated that certain methods had been deprecated, which immediately pointed me to a potential version mismatch.

#### Solution:

To resolve this, I pinned the versions of the libraries in the file. This was crucial to avoid potential future compatibility issues. Below is the updated version of the file:

Once the versions were aligned, I ran tests in a virtual environment (Conda) to verify the installation worked across multiple systems.

### Week 2 - Initial GPU Performance and Memory Usage

#### Task: Optimizing GPU/CPU Usage

As the project progressed, I shifted focus to monitoring GPU memory usage. Training a deep model like DETR on large datasets such as COCO can lead to substantial GPU memory overhead, especially when the **batch size** is large. The model’s architecture, which integrates both CNN and Transformer components, is memory-intensive.

I noticed a significant slowdown in training speed, accompanied by memory allocation errors. The GPU was being overwhelmed, causing out-of-memory (OOM) errors, especially with larger batches.

#### Solution:

I optimized the memory usage by experimenting with **smaller batch sizes**. Additionally, I enabled **mixed precision training** using PyTorch’s native AMP (Automatic Mixed Precision), which helped reduce the memory footprint by utilizing 16-bit floating-point precision. Here's how I implemented mixed precision training:

This provided a significant improvement, allowing me to increase the batch size while maintaining memory efficiency.

### Week 3 - Debugging Data Loading Issues

#### Task: Efficient Data Loading

In Week 3, I turned my attention to optimizing **data loading** and pipeline efficiency. Initially, the data loading process was slow, which was bottlenecking training speed. I realized that **data augmentation** operations, such as random resizing and horizontal flipping, were being applied on the CPU during the training loop, significantly slowing down the overall process.

#### Solution:

I optimized the ****by using multi-threaded data loading and moving as much of the preprocessing as possible to the GPU. PyTorch’s has a argument, which I increased to parallelize the data loading process across multiple CPU cores.

By increasing , I saw a noticeable boost in training speed. However, I had to balance this against GPU performance, as too many workers could lead to GPU starvation if not managed carefully.

* * *

### Week 4 - Bug Tracking and Issue Resolution

#### Task: Bug Tracking & Issue Resolution

By Week 4, I was focusing on debugging several minor issues that arose during training and inference. The model occasionally produced **NaN (Not-a-Number)** values in the loss function during training, especially when using large learning rates. This issue was difficult to track because it only occurred intermittently, which suggested that it was related to exploding gradients in the Transformer component.

#### Solution:

I implemented **gradient clipping** to prevent the gradients from becoming too large and destabilizing the training process. By capping the gradient values, I was able to prevent NaNs from appearing in the loss function:

After applying gradient clipping, the training became much more stable, and NaN values no longer appeared in the loss calculations. This allowed me to maintain a higher learning rate without destabilizing the training process.
