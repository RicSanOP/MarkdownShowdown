# Geographical Overview of Europe and Earth

Europe, often referred to as a "peninsula of peninsulas," is the second smallest continent by land area, covering about 10.18 million square kilometers (3.93 million square miles). It comprises approximately 44 countries, with key peninsulas including the Iberian, Scandinavian, and Italian peninsulas. Europe is characterized by significant mountain ranges such as the Alps and the Pyrenees, which play a crucial role in influencing the continent's climate and culture. 

The continent is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Mediterranean Sea to the south, and Asia to the east. Notably, Russia is the largest country that spans both Europe and Asia.

In a broader context, Earth's geography is characterized by its oblate spheroid shape—it is slightly flattened at the poles and bulges at the equator. About 71% of Earth's surface is covered by water, predominately in the form of oceans. Earth is divided into seven continents—[[Africa]], [[Antarctica]], [[Asia]], [[Europe]], [[North America]], [[Australia]], and [[South America]].

Key geographical markers that define Earth's hemispheres include the Prime Meridian, located at 0° longitude, which divides the Earth into the Eastern and Western Hemispheres. It runs through Greenwich, England. Similarly, the equator, an imaginary line at 0° latitude, divides the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.
