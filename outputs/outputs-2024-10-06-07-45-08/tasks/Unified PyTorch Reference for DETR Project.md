## Content

### Introduction to PyTorch
PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library developed by Facebook's AI Research lab. It is known for its ease of use and flexibility, making it a popular choice for deep learning projects.

### Core Data Structure: Tensors
Tensors are the core data structure in PyTorch. They are similar to NumPy arrays but can be used on GPUs. Tensors are multi-dimensional arrays that can be used to store and manipulate data.

### Autograd System
PyTorch's autograd system automatically computes gradients, which are essential for training neural networks. This system allows for efficient gradient computation and backpropagation.

### Creating Models
Models in PyTorch are typically created by subclassing `torch.nn.Module`. This class allows for easy definition of neural network architectures.

### Optimizers
PyTorch provides several optimizers, including Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam. These optimizers are used to update the parameters of the model during training.

### Data Handling with Datasets and DataLoaders
PyTorch's `Dataset` and `DataLoader` classes are used to handle data. `Dataset` is an abstract class representing a dataset, and `DataLoader` is used to load data in batches.

### Typical Training Loop
A typical training loop in PyTorch involves loading data, forwarding it through the model, computing the loss, backpropagating the gradients, and updating the model parameters.

### GPU/CPU Switching
PyTorch allows for easy switching between CPU and GPU. This is done using the `.to()` method on tensors and models.

### Saving and Loading Models
PyTorch provides functionalities to save and load models. This is useful for checkpointing and resuming training.
