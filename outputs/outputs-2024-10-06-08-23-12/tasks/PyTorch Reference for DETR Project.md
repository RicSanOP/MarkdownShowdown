# PyTorch Reference for DETR Project

This note serves as a comprehensive guide to PyTorch for the DETR project, covering essential concepts such as tensors, autograd, modules and models, optimizers, datasets and dataloaders, training loops, GPU/CPU switching, and saving and loading models. Each section provides a concise explanation of the topic, making it a valuable resource for team members working on the project.

## Introduction to PyTorch Reference

Here’s a condensed reference to **PyTorch** for working on the DETR project:

## 1. Tensors

- PyTorch’s core data structure is the **Tensor**, similar to NumPy arrays but optimized for GPUs.

## 2. Autograd

- PyTorch automatically computes gradients for backpropagation using **autograd**.

## 3. Modules & Models

- Models are created using the **class**. This is where layers and forward pass logic are defined.

## 4. Optimizers

- PyTorch provides optimizers like SGD, Adam, etc., for updating model parameters.

## 5. Datasets & DataLoaders

- The **class** is used to load datasets and handle batching.

## 6. Training Loop

- A typical PyTorch training loop includes:
  1. Forward pass
  2. Loss computation
  3. Backward pass
  4. Optimizer step

## 7. GPU/CPU Switching

- Models and data can be transferred between CPU and GPU using:

## 8. Saving and Loading Models

- Models are saved and loaded using and.

## Conclusion of PyTorch Reference

These concepts will help you efficiently work on DETR and manage its deep learning components.
