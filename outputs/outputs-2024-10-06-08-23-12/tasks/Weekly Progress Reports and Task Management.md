## Task Management Notes

### How I Did

**Note Path: Week 3 Report.md**
**Author: rifaat**

#### How I Did:

* I used an initial learning rate of 1e-4, with weight decay to prevent overfitting. Based on training observations, I experimented with a **learning rate scheduler** and **early stopping criteria** to improve convergence stability.

### Problems

**Note Path: Week 3 Report.md**
**Author: rifaat**

#### Problems:

* Noticed that the model was converging too quickly, potentially overfitting to early stages of training, with validation performance plateauing.

### Resolution

**Note Path: Week 3 Report.md**
**Author: rifaat**

#### Resolution:

* Lowered the learning rate and introduced **gradient clipping** to stabilize the training process. Early stopping was used to prevent overfitting. I also increased the number of training epochs to allow for more robust convergence.

### Issues Encountered

**Note Path: Week 4 Report.md**
**Author: rifaat**

#### Problems:

* The [[Convolutional Neural Network|ResNet-101]] model's higher memory requirements caused **GPU memory limitations**, especially when using larger batch sizes, resulting in out-of-memory errors during training.

### Solutions Implemented

**Note Path: Week 4 Report.md**
**Author: rifaat**

#### Resolution:

* Reduced the batch size to fit within the available GPU memory and used **gradient accumulation** to compensate for the smaller batch size, maintaining training stability. Additionally, I optimized the data loader to prefetch smaller batches efficiently to reduce overhead.

### Challenges in Training Process

**Note Path: Project Reflections.md**
**Author: suhas**

While the architecture itself has been solid, managing the training process for a model of this complexity has involved overcoming several technical hurdles, particularly related to memory optimization and data handling.

### Learning the Importance of System Optimization

**Author: suhas**

In retrospect, I’ve learned the importance of **system optimization** in large-scale machine learning projects. Handling **GPU memory**, **data pipeline efficiency**, and **training stability** are critical aspects that can easily be overlooked in the initial design phases but can make or break the success of a model's deployment in production.

### Excitement for Future Phases

### Devlog - Week 2: Initial GPU Performance and Memory Usage

**Note Path: Devlog.md**
**Author: suhas**

### Week 2 - Initial GPU Performance and Memory Usage

**Task: Optimizing GPU/CPU Usage**

As the project progressed, I shifted focus to monitoring GPU memory usage. Training a deep model like DETR on large datasets such as COCO can lead to substantial GPU memory overhead, especially when the **batch size** is large. The model’s architecture, which integrates both CNN and Transformer components, is memory-intensive.

I noticed a significant slowdown in training speed, accompanied by memory allocation errors. The GPU was being overwhelmed, causing out-of-memory (OOM) errors, especially with larger batches.

#### Solution:

I optimized the memory usage by experimenting with **smaller batch sizes**. Additionally, I enabled **mixed precision training** using PyTorch’s native AMP (Automatic Mixed Precision), which helped reduce the memory footprint by utilizing 16-bit floating-point precision. Here's how I implemented mixed precision training:

This provided a significant improvement, allowing me to increase the batch size while maintaining memory efficiency.

### Devlog - Week 3: Debugging Data Loading Issues

**Note Path: Devlog.md**
**Author: suhas**

### Week 3 - Debugging Data Loading Issues

**Task: Efficient Data Loading**

In Week 3, I turned my attention to optimizing **data loading** and pipeline efficiency. Initially, the data loading process was slow, which was bottlenecking training speed. I realized that **data augmentation** operations, such as random resizing and horizontal flipping, were being applied on the CPU during the training loop, significantly slowing down the overall process.

#### Solution:

I optimized the data loading by using multi-threaded data loading and moving as much of the preprocessing as possible to the GPU. PyTorch’s has a argument, which I increased to parallelize the data loading process across multiple CPU cores.

By increasing , I saw a noticeable boost in training speed. However, I had to balance this against GPU performance, as too many workers could lead to GPU starvation if not managed carefully.

### Devlog - Week 4: Bug Tracking and Issue Resolution

**Note Path: Devlog.md**
**Author: suhas**

### Week 4 - Bug Tracking & Issue Resolution

**Task: Bug Tracking & Issue Resolution**

By Week 4, I was focusing on debugging several minor issues that arose during training and inference. The model occasionally produced **NaN (Not-a-Number)** values in the loss function during training, especially when using large learning rates. This issue was difficult to track because it only occurred intermittently, which suggested that it was related to exploding gradients in the Transformer component.

#### Solution:

I implemented **gradient clipping** to prevent the gradients from becoming too large and destabilizing the training process. By capping the gradient values, I was able to prevent NaNs from appearing in the loss function:

After applying gradient clipping, the training became much more stable, and NaN values no longer appeared in the loss calculations. This allowed me to maintain a higher learning rate without destabilizing the training process.
