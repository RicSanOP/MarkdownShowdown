## Project Objectives

### DETR Project Overview
  - Train and fine-tune the DETR model on the **COCO dataset**.
  - Optimize performance, focusing on memory efficiency, training speed, and accuracy.
  - Deploy and evaluate the model against benchmarks to test real-world applicability.

## Dependency and Environment Management

### DETR Project Overview
  - Ensured that all dependencies (e.g., **PyTorch**, **torchvision**, **COCO API**) were correctly installed and version-compatible.
  - Set up and managed the development environment using **Conda**, ensuring seamless setup across different platforms.
  - Updated for ease of reproducibility and streamlined collaboration among team members.

### Devlog (Week 1)
  - **Task: Dependency Management and Environment Setup**
    - In the first week, my primary focus was getting the development environment up and running. After reviewing the project dependencies, it became clear that the version compatibility between **PyTorch**, **torchvision**, and the **COCO API** might be a pain point. My initial task was to ensure that all dependencies were correctly installed and working seamlessly.
    - I encountered version issues with the **COCO API**, specifically when attempting to load the dataset. The error message indicated that certain methods had been deprecated, which immediately pointed me to a potential version mismatch.
    - **Solution:** To resolve this, I pinned the versions of the libraries in the file. This was crucial to avoid potential future compatibility issues. Below is the updated version of the file:
    - Once the versions were aligned, I ran tests in a virtual environment (Conda) to verify the installation worked across multiple systems.
