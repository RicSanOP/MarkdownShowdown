# PyTorch Reference

Here’s a condensed reference to **PyTorch** for working on the DETR project:

## Tensors in PyTorch

Note Path: PyTorch Reference.md
Author: suhas

### 1. Tensors

  * PyTorch’s core data structure is the **Tensor**, similar to NumPy arrays but optimized for GPUs.

## Autograd in PyTorch

Note Path: PyTorch Reference.md
Author: suhas

### 2. Autograd

  * PyTorch automatically computes gradients for backpropagation using **autograd**.

## Modules and Models in PyTorch

Note Path: PyTorch Reference.md
Author: suhas

### 3. Modules & Models

  * Models are created using the `class`. This is where layers and forward pass logic are defined.

## Optimizers in PyTorch

Note Path: PyTorch Reference.md
Author: suhas

### 4. Optimizers

  * PyTorch provides optimizers like SGD, Adam, etc., for updating model parameters.

## Datasets and DataLoaders in PyTorch

Note Path: PyTorch Reference.md
Author: suhas

### 5. Datasets & DataLoaders

  * The `class` is used to load datasets and handle batching.

## Training Loop in PyTorch

Note Path: PyTorch Reference.md
Author: suhas

### 6. Training Loop

  * A typical PyTorch training loop includes:
    1. Forward pass
    2. Loss computation
    3. Backward pass
    4. Optimizer step

## GPU/CPU Switching in PyTorch

Note Path: PyTorch Reference.md
Author: suhas

### 7. GPU/CPU Switching

  * Models and data can be transferred between CPU and GPU using:

## Saving and Loading Models in PyTorch

Note Path: PyTorch Reference.md
Author: suhas

### 8. Saving and Loading Models

  * Models are saved and loaded using `torch.save` and `torch.load`.
