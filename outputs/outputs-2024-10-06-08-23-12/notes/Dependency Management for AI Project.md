# Dependency Management for AI Project

## Summary
This note details the essential aspects of dependency management for the AI project. It covers the review and update of required dependencies, the setup of a Conda environment for seamless installation, and the management of primary and optional dependencies. Additionally, it discusses the importance of regular dependency updates and the use of Conda for environment management to ensure compatibility and simplify collaboration. The note also includes specific tasks assigned to the Software Engineer and the necessary libraries and versions for the project.

## Justification
The title 'Dependency Management for AI Project' was chosen because it encapsulates the core theme of the provided chunks, which focus on managing and updating dependencies such as PyTorch and torchvision. This title is simple yet comprehensive, highlighting the importance of dependency management within the context of the AI project.

### Meeting Notes Week 1 - Software Engineer's Contributions
**Software Engineer:**
- Completed a review of the required dependencies.
- Updated the file with PyTorch, torchvision, and other necessary libraries.
- Next: Will set up the Conda environment and test installation on multiple platforms.

### Dependency Management
**Dependency Management** Ensure that required libraries (PyTorch, torchvision, etc.) are correctly installed and update as needed. Software Engineer

### Primary Dependencies
# Dependency Management

1. **Primary Dependencies:**
   - **PyTorch 1.5+** : Core deep learning framework used for model implementation and training.
   - **torchvision 0.6+** : For handling datasets and model architectures.
   - **pycocotools** : Required for evaluating the model on the COCO dataset.
   - **scipy** : Used for various scientific computations during model training.

### Managing Dependencies
2. **Managing Dependencies:**
   - **Conda environment** : Recommended for creating isolated environments and managing Python dependencies.
   - **Install Command** :

### Optional Dependencies
3. **Optional Dependencies:**
   - **Panoptic API** : Required for panoptic segmentation tasks. Install with:

### Dependency Updates
4. **Dependency Updates:**
   - Regularly check for updates to PyTorch, torchvision, and other packages to ensure compatibility.
   - Maintain a file for version tracking.

### Managing Dependencies with Conda
Managing dependencies with a clear installation process and environment management via Conda will minimize issues with mismatched versions and simplify collaboration.
