## Introduction to COCO Dataset

# COCO Dataset

The COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset is a large-scale image dataset designed for object detection, segmentation, keypoint detection, and captioning. It consists of over 200,000 labeled images and 80 object categories, with more than 1.5 million object instances. COCO is unique due to its focus on object detection in complex, cluttered scenes with multiple objects per image.

The dataset also provides annotations for object segmentation, making it valuable for tasks like instance and panoptic segmentation. COCO is widely used for benchmarking machine learning models in object detection and segmentation.

## Data Preparation for COCO Dataset

### Data Preparation

1. **Dataset: COCO (Common Objects in Context)**
   - [[Detection Transformer Model Architecture]] (DETR) is primarily trained on the COCO dataset, which contains images with labeled objects for object detection tasks.
   - **COCO 2017 Dataset** : Download and unzip the train and validation splits. The dataset can be found [here](<https>).

### Dataset Structure for COCO

2. **Dataset Structure** :
   - Images and annotations are separated into the following folders:
     * : contains training images.
     * : contains validation images.
     * : contains JSON files with corresponding annotations.

### Data Loading for COCO Dataset

3. **Data Loading** :
   - Utilize **torchvision’s COCO dataset wrapper** for data loading:
   - This will automatically parse COCO images and annotations into a usable format for training.

### Data Augmentation and Preprocessing for COCO

4. **Data Augmentation and Preprocessing** :
   - DETR uses **random resizing** and **horizontal flipping** for data augmentation during training. You can find the augmentations in the module.
   - Example of applying augmentations:

### Handling Annotations for COCO Dataset

5. **Handling Annotations** :
   - Ensure the annotations are loaded in the correct format using COCO's method. COCO uses bounding boxes and segmentation masks, which are key for training DETR.

### Class and Label Mapping for COCO Dataset

6. **Class and Label Mapping** :
   - Map COCO’s 80 classes to the corresponding object classes in the DETR model. This is handled automatically when using the.

## Summary of My Role

#### Summary of My Role:

The software engineering aspect of the project involves balancing **performance optimization**, **infrastructure management**, and **debugging**, all while ensuring that the deep learning pipelines operate efficiently. The complexities of training **large Transformer models** like DETR on massive datasets such as COCO introduced various challenges, particularly around **memory and speed optimization**. My role has provided a deep dive into the intersection of **software engineering** and **machine learning**, which I’ve found both rewarding and challenging. Moving forward, I anticipate further refining the model's deployment for real-world applications, ensuring that it performs well both in terms of speed and accuracy.

## Devlog - Week 1: Initial Setup and Dependency Management

### Week 1 - Initial Setup and Dependency Management

**Task: Dependency Management and Environment Setup**

In the first week, my primary focus was getting the development environment up and running. After reviewing the project dependencies, it became clear that the version compatibility between **PyTorch**, **torchvision**, and the **COCO API** might be a pain point. My initial task was to ensure that all dependencies were correctly installed and working seamlessly.

I encountered version issues with the **COCO API**, specifically when attempting to load the dataset. The error message indicated that certain methods had been deprecated, which immediately pointed me to a potential version mismatch.

#### Solution:

To resolve this, I pinned the versions of the libraries in the file. This was crucial to avoid potential future compatibility issues. Below is the updated version of the file:

Once the versions were aligned, I ran tests in a virtual environment (Conda) to verify the installation worked across multiple systems.
