# PyTorch Reference for DETR Project

Here’s a condensed reference to **PyTorch** for working on the DETR project:

### 1. Tensors

* PyTorch’s core data structure is the **Tensor**, similar to NumPy arrays but optimized for GPUs.

### 2. Autograd

* PyTorch automatically computes gradients for backpropagation using **autograd**.

### 3. Modules & Models

* Models are created using the **class**. This is where layers and forward pass logic are defined.

### 4. Optimizers

* PyTorch provides optimizers like SGD, Adam, etc., for updating model parameters.

### 5. Datasets & DataLoaders

* The **class** is used to load datasets and handle batching.

### 6. Training Loop

* A typical PyTorch training loop includes:
  1. Forward pass
  2. Loss computation
  3. Backward pass
  4. Optimizer step

### 7. GPU/CPU Switching

* Models and data can be transferred between CPU and GPU using:

### 8. Saving and Loading Models

* Models are saved and loaded using `torch.save` and `torch.load`.

These concepts will help you efficiently work on DETR and manage its deep learning components.
