# Comprehensive Project Documentation on DETR Model Development and Implementation

## Overview

This document provides an extensive overview of the Detection Transformer (DETR) model development and implementation on the COCO dataset. It covers various aspects of the project including documentation tasks, dependency management, software optimizations, model training, evaluation metrics, and key roles played by team members throughout the project lifecycle.

## Project Planning and Meetings

In the initial phases, the **Technical Project Manager** played a crucial role in project planning, creating a roadmap, and constructing a high-level timeline to achieve key milestones. Documentation tasks were prioritized, including reviewing code structure and completing user guides for the DETR model setup.

Regular meetings contributed significantly to progress tracking and strategy adjustments. In Week 2, the team focused on organizing documentation updates and commencement of the evaluation criteria for model performance, as laid out by the Technical Project Manager. Meeting notes hinted at discussions around dependency management and data loading optimizations by the **Software Engineer**. For further details, see [[Meeting Notes Week 2]].

## Software Engineering

The **Software Engineer** addressed performance bottlenecks within the software infrastructure. This involved setting up the Conda environment and verifying the installation of crucial dependencies like [[PyTorch]], torchvision, and pycocotools. GPU memory optimization efforts included data loading efficiency and fine-tuning batch sizes for better resource allocation. For more on optimization strategies, refer to [[Dependencies and Environment Setup]] and [[Optimization Techniques]].

## Machine Learning and Model Training

The **Machine Learning Researcher** spearheaded the development and fine-tuning of the DETR model, employing both ResNet-50 and ResNet-101 backbones. Challenges encountered during training, such as early convergence and resource limitations, were addressed by adjusting hyperparameters and using techniques like gradient clipping. Progress in evaluating running training models against the COCO validation set was also documented. Details on training strategies can be accessed through [[Model Training Techniques]] and [[Evaluation Criteria]].

### Data Preparation and Augmentation

Data preparation involved the download, structuring, and preprocessing of the COCO 2017 dataset. Data augmentation strategies employed included random resizing and horizontal flipping, which were crucial for training generalization.

### Performance Benchmarking

Model benchmarking on the COCO validation set was essential to assessing DETR against traditional object detectors, performing tasks such as calculating mAP and IoU. The aim was to ensure comprehensive testing across diverse scenarios.

## Dependency Management

Dependencies such as PyTorch and pycocotools were carefully reviewed for version compatibility, and the project utilized Conda environments for isolated setup across platforms. Key dependencies were documented for ease of reproducibility.

## Tools and Infrastructure

The team used a blend of programming frameworks and tools to facilitate both model training and deployment. Efforts for performance enhancement included optimizing both GPU and CPU usage and exploiting mixed precision training for memory efficiency.

## Challenges and Future Directions

A crucial challenge was mitigating infrastructure limitations. Future areas of exploration include refining the deployment pipeline for real-world applications, balancing the trade-off between speed and inference accuracy, and extensive benchmarking.
