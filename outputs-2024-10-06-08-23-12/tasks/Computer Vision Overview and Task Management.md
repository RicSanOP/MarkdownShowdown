# Computer Vision Overview and Task Management

## Justification

The title 'Computer Vision Overview and Task Management' was chosen because it encapsulates the broad scope of the provided chunks, covering both foundational knowledge about computer vision and task-related notes. This title is simple yet comprehensive, reflecting the content which includes introductions, challenges, history, and recent developments in computer vision, as well as project management notes.

## Summary

This note provides a comprehensive overview of computer vision, including an introduction to the field, its challenges, and a historical timeline from its inception in the 1950s to recent developments such as DETR. It also includes further reading references and links to related topics like CNNs and Transformers. Additionally, the note serves as a project knowledge base, incorporating task management aspects and relevant links to other notes like 'What is Computer Vision?'

## What is Computer Vision?

Computer Vision is a subfield of Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence where humans teach computers to see and interpret the world around them.

## Challenges of Computer Vision

While humans and animals naturally solve vision as a problem from a very young age, helping machines interpret and perceive their surroundings via vision remains a largely unsolved problem. Limited perception of the human vision along with the infinitely varying scenery of our dynamic world is what makes Machine Vision complex at its core.
