# Comprehensive Guide to Computer Vision and Training Techniques

## Introduction

This note provides a comprehensive overview of computer vision, including its definition as a subfield of deep learning and AI that teaches computers to interpret the world visually. It covers the history of computer vision, from its early beginnings in the 1950s to recent developments like DETR. The note also delves into the challenges of machine vision, such as the complexity of interpreting dynamic environments. Additionally, it discusses training techniques, including the use of learning rate schedulers and early stopping criteria to improve model convergence. The note also touches on technical hurdles faced during the training process, such as memory optimization and data handling, and expresses excitement for future phases of the project, particularly focusing on inference optimization.

## What is Computer Vision?

Computer Vision is a subfield of Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence where humans teach computers to see and interpret the world around them.

## Challenges of Computer Vision

While humans and animals naturally solve vision as a problem from a very young age, helping machines interpret and perceive their surroundings via vision remains a largely unsolved problem. Limited perception of the human vision along with the infinitely varying scenery of our dynamic world is what makes Machine Vision complex at its core.

## History of Computer Vision

### Early Beginnings

- **1956**: "Artificial Intelligence"
- **1959**: Neuropsychology: Discover vision is hierarchical
- **1960s**: First computer vision project (MIT summer project)

### AI Winter and Early Neural Networks

- **1970s**: "AI winter"
- **1990s**: Rudimentary neural networks

### Recent Developments

- **2020**: [[DETR]] (Facebook)

## Training Techniques

### How I Did

- I used an initial learning rate of 1e-4, with weight decay to prevent overfitting. Based on training observations, I experimented with a **learning rate scheduler** and **early stopping criteria** to improve convergence stability.

## Technical Hurdles

While the architecture itself has been solid, managing the training process for a model of this complexity has involved overcoming several technical hurdles, particularly related to memory optimization and data handling.

## Excitement for Future Phases

Iâ€™m excited to see how the final model will perform in real-world benchmarks and eager to dive deeper into **inference optimization** in the next phase of the project.
