# Comprehensive Geographical Overview: Continental and Oceanic Features

## Introduction to Europe's Geographical Status
Europe is the second smallest continent by land area, covering about 10.18 million square kilometers (3.93 million square miles).

## Geographical Features of Europe
Europe is often referred to as a "peninsula of peninsulas" because it's made up of smaller peninsulas, including the Iberian, Scandinavian, and Italian peninsulas. The Alps and the Pyrenees are two of Europe's major mountain ranges, influencing climate and culture in the surrounding regions.

## Country Composition and Borders of Europe
Europe is home to approximately 44 countries, with Russia being the largest. It's important to note that Russia spans both Europe and Asia. The continent is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the west by the Atlantic Ocean, to the south by the Mediterranean Sea, and to the east by Asia.

## Earth's Shape and Its Ocean Coverage
Earth is an oblate spheroid, meaning it's slightly flattened at the poles and bulges at the equator. About 71% of Earth's surface is covered by water, primarily in the form of oceans.

## Geographical Markers and Continents
The Prime Meridian, located at 0° longitude, runs through Greenwich, England, and divides the Earth into the Eastern and Western Hemispheres. Earth's landmasses are divided into seven continents: Africa, Antarctica, Asia, Europe, North America, Australia, and South America. The equator is an imaginary line around the middle of Earth at 0° latitude, dividing the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.
