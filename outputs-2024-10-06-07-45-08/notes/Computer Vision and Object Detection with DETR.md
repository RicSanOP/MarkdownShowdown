## Introduction to Computer Vision
Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to interpret and understand the visual world. This technology has wide-ranging applications, from autonomous vehicles to medical imaging. The evolution of computer vision has been marked by significant milestones, with recent advancements in deep learning models playing a pivotal role.

## The DETR Model
The DETR (Detection Transformer) model is a cutting-edge approach to object detection that leverages the power of transformers. Unlike traditional object detection models that rely on region proposals, DETR treats object detection as a direct set prediction problem. This simplifies the pipeline and enhances the model's efficiency.

## Project Activities

### Training the DETR Model
Our project involved training the DETR model using different backbones, including ResNet-50 and ResNet-101. By experimenting with these backbones, we aimed to understand their impact on the model's performance.

### Hyperparameter Tuning
Hyperparameter tuning is a critical step in optimizing the performance of machine learning models. We conducted extensive tuning to find the optimal set of hyperparameters for the DETR model, ensuring it performs well on the COCO dataset.

### Performance Evaluation
We evaluated the model's performance on the COCO dataset, which is a widely used benchmark for object detection tasks. The evaluation metrics included precision, recall, and mean average precision (mAP).

## Visualization of Object Detection Techniques
Snapshots from various reports illustrate the application of object detection techniques, such as bounding boxes and heatmaps. These visualizations highlight the model's effectiveness in detecting and localizing objects within images.
