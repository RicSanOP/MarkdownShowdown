# Dependency Management and Environment Setup

## Summary
This note compiles information on managing dependencies and setting up the development environment for the AI project. It includes details from meeting notes where the software engineer reviewed required dependencies, updated the file with necessary libraries, and set up the Conda environment. It also discusses performance bottlenecks identified during initial tests and plans to optimize data loading and memory usage. Additionally, the note outlines the primary and optional dependencies, the use of Conda for environment management, and the importance of regular dependency updates to ensure compatibility.

## Justification
The title 'Dependency Management and Environment Setup' is chosen because the provided chunks focus on the management of project dependencies and the setup of the development environment. The chunks discuss reviewing dependencies, setting up Conda environments, optimizing performance, and managing updates, all of which are critical aspects of dependency management and environment setup.

## Contents

### Reviewing Dependencies
During our meeting, the software engineer reviewed the required dependencies for the project. The primary dependencies include libraries such as `numpy`, `pandas`, and `scikit-learn`. Optional dependencies, which are used for specific tasks or optimizations, include `tensorflow` and `torch`.

### Setting Up Conda Environment
The Conda environment was set up to manage the project dependencies. The following steps were taken:

1. Install Conda if not already installed.
2. Create a new Conda environment with the necessary dependencies.
3. Activate the Conda environment before running the project.

Here is an example of the `environment.yml` file used to set up the environment:

```yaml
name: ai_project_env
dependencies:
  - python=3.8
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - scikit-learn
  - tensorflow
  - torch
```

### Optimizing Performance
Initial tests identified performance bottlenecks in data loading and memory usage. The team discussed plans to optimize data loading by using more efficient data structures and improving memory usage through garbage collection techniques.

### Managing Updates
Regular updates to dependencies are crucial to ensure compatibility and take advantage of new features and bug fixes. The team agreed to review and update dependencies every quarter to maintain a stable and secure development environment.
