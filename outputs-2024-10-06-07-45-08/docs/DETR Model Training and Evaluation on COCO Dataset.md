## Introduction
The Detection Transformer (DETR) model is a state-of-the-art object detection model that leverages transformers for object detection tasks. This note documents the process of training and evaluating the DETR model on the COCO dataset.

## Data Preparation
### Downloading and Preprocessing COCO Dataset
To prepare the COCO dataset for training, we first downloaded the dataset from the official COCO website. The dataset was then preprocessed to ensure it was in the correct format for training the DETR model. This included converting annotations and resizing images.

### Data Augmentation
Data augmentation techniques such as random cropping, flipping, and rotation were implemented to increase the diversity of the training data and improve the model's robustness.

## Model Training
### Training with ResNet-50 and ResNet-101 Backbones
The DETR model was trained using both ResNet-50 and ResNet-101 backbones. The training process involved several epochs with a batch size of 16. The training loss and validation accuracy were monitored to ensure the model was learning effectively.

### Fine-Tuning Hyperparameters
Hyperparameters such as learning rate, weight decay, and dropout rate were fine-tuned to optimize the model's performance. Cross-validation was used to select the best set of hyperparameters.

## Evaluation Metrics
### mAP and IoU
The model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as mean Average Precision (mAP) and Intersection over Union (IoU). These metrics provided insights into the model's accuracy and precision in detecting objects.

## Issues and Resolutions
### Data Loading Issues
During the training process, we encountered issues with data loading. These were resolved by optimizing the data pipeline and using efficient data loading techniques.

### Model Convergence
The model initially struggled to converge. This was addressed by adjusting the learning rate schedule and implementing gradient clipping.

## Meeting Notes
### Meeting 1
Discussed the initial project objectives and set up a timeline for data preparation and model training.

### Meeting 2
Reviewed the preliminary results of the model training and discussed potential improvements.

## Project Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to achieve high accuracy in object detection using the DETR model on the COCO dataset. Secondary objectives include optimizing the training process and documenting the entire workflow for future reference.
