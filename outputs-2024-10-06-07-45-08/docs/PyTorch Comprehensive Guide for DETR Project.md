## Tensors
Tensors are the fundamental data structure in PyTorch. They are similar to NumPy arrays but can also be used on a GPU to accelerate computing.

```python
import torch

# Creating a tensor
x = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
print(x)
```

## Autograd
Autograd is PyTorch's automatic differentiation engine that provides automatic computation of gradient.

```python
x = torch.tensor([3.0], requires_grad=True)
y = x ** 2
y.backward()
print(x.grad)
```

## Modules and Models
PyTorch uses a modular approach to build neural networks. `torch.nn` is a module that provides functionalities to create and train neural networks.

```python
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(1, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)

model = SimpleModel()
```

## Optimizers
Optimizers are algorithms used to update the weights of the model to minimize the loss function.

```python
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
```

## Datasets and Dataloaders
Datasets and Dataloaders are utilities provided by PyTorch to handle and load the data efficiently.

```python
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset

# Create a dataset
dataset = TensorDataset(torch.tensor([[1.0], [2.0], [3.0]]), torch.tensor([[2.0], [4.0], [6.0]]))

# Create a dataloader
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=2, shuffle=True)
```

## Training Loops
A typical training loop involves iterating over the dataset, computing the loss, backpropagating the gradients, and updating the model parameters.

```python
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for inputs, labels in dataloader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = loss_function(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
```

## GPU/CPU Switching
PyTorch provides easy switching between GPU and CPU for computation.

```python
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
model.to(device)
```

## Saving and Loading Models
PyTorch allows saving and loading models to and from disk.

```python
# Save the model
torch.save(model.state_dict(), "model.pth")

# Load the model
model.load_state_dict(torch.load("model.pth"))
```
