Unlike recurrent neural networks (RNNs), transformers do not process data sequentially, but instead handle it all at once, making them highly parallelizable and efficient. They are based on the concept of self-attention, which allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sentence when encoding or decoding information.\n&lt;/chunk&gt;", "&lt;chunk&gt;\n&lt;info&gt;Core Components of Transformers\nNote Path: Transformers.md\nAuthor: george&lt;/info&gt;\nThe core components of a transformer model include the encoder and decoder, each composed of stacked layers of multi-head self-attention and feed-forward neural networks. The self-attention mechanism enables the model to understand the context and dependencies between words, regardless of their distance in the sequence. This makes transformers particularly effective for tasks like machine translation, text summarization, and question answering.\n&lt;/chunk&gt;", "&lt;chunk&gt;\n&lt;info&gt;Meeting Notes Week 3 - Introduction and Previous Meeting Link\nNote Path: Meeting Notes Week 3.md\nAuthor: george&lt;/info&gt;\n# Meeting Notes Week 3\n\n**Previous Meeting** : [[Meeting Notes Week 2]] **Next Meeting** : [[Meeting Notes Week 4]] **Attendees:** Technical Project Manager, Software Engineer, Machine Learning Researcher\n&lt;/chunk&gt;", "&lt;chunk&gt;\n&lt;info&gt;Meeting Notes Week 3 - Technical Project Manager Discussion\nNote Path: Meeting Notes Week 3.md\nAuthor: george&lt;/info&gt;\n#### Discussion:\n\n  * **Technical Project Manager:**\n\n    * Completed the first draft of the user guide for setting up and fine-tuning the model.\n    * Will start preparing evaluation reports for weekly progress tracking.\n&lt;/chunk&gt;", "&lt;chunk&gt;\n&lt;info&gt;Meeting Notes Week 3 - Software Engineer Discussion\nNote Path: Meeting Notes Week 3.md\nAuthor: george&lt;/info&gt;\n  * **Software Engineer:**\n\n    * Resolved GPU bottleneck issues by adjusting batch sizes and optimizing data preprocessing.\n    * Next: Monitor training speed and ensure performance is consistent.\n&lt;/chunk&gt;", "&lt;chunk&gt;\n&lt;info&gt;Meeting Notes Week 3 - Machine Learning Researcher Discussion\nNote Path: Meeting Notes Week 3.md\nAuthor: george&lt;/info&gt;\n  * **Machine Learning Researcher:**\n\n    * Began training with ResNet-50 and ResNet-101 models, monitoring loss and validation metrics.\n    * Next: Experiment with learning rate adjustments and conduct performance evaluations with the COCO validation set.\n&lt;/chunk&gt;", "&lt;chunk&gt;\n&lt;info&gt;Introduction to Computer Vision\nNote Path: What is Computer Vision?.md\nAuthor: george&lt;/info&gt;\n# What is Computer Vision?\n\nComputer Vision is a subfield of Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence where humans teach computers to see and interpret the world around them.\n&lt;/chunk&gt;", "&lt;chunk&gt;\n&lt;info&gt;Challenges of Computer Vision\nNote Path: What is Computer Vision?.md\nAuthor: george&lt;/info&gt;\nWhile humans and animals naturally solve vision as a problem from a very young age, helping machines interpret and perceive their surroundings via vision remains a largely unsolved problem.

After reviewing the project dependencies, it became clear that the version compatibility between **PyTorch** , **torchvision** , and the **COCO API** might be a pain point. My initial task was to ensure that all dependencies were correctly installed and working seamlessly.\n\nI encountered version issues with the **COCO API** , specifically when attempting to load the dataset. The error message indicated that certain methods had been deprecated, which immediately pointed me to a potential version mismatch.\n\n#### Solution:\n\nTo resolve this, I pinned the versions of the libraries in the file. This was crucial to avoid potential future compatibility issues. Below is the updated version of the file:\n\nOnce the versions were aligned, I ran tests in a virtual environment (Conda) to verify the installation worked across multiple systems.\n\n* * *\n&lt;/chunk&gt;", "&lt;chunk&gt;\n&lt;info&gt;Devlog - Week 2: Initial GPU Performance and Memory Usage\nNote Path: Devlog.md\nAuthor: suhas&lt;/info&gt;\n\n### Week 2 - Initial GPU Performance and Memory Usage\n\n**Task: Optimizing GPU/CPU Usage**\n\nAs the project progressed, I shifted focus to monitoring GPU memory usage. Training a deep model like DETR on large datasets such as COCO can lead to substantial GPU memory overhead, especially when the **batch size** is large. The model\u2019s architecture, which integrates both CNN and Transformer components, is memory-intensive.\n\nI noticed a significant slowdown in training speed, accompanied by memory allocation errors. The GPU was being overwhelmed, causing out-of-memory (OOM) errors, especially with larger batches.\n\n#### Solution:\n\nI optimized the memory usage by experimenting with **smaller batch sizes**. Additionally, I enabled **mixed precision training** using PyTorch\u2019s native AMP (Automatic Mixed Precision), which helped reduce the memory footprint by utilizing 16-bit floating-point precision. Here's how I implemented mixed precision training:\n\nThis provided a significant improvement, allowing me to increase the batch size while maintaining memory efficiency.\n\n* * *\n&lt;/chunk&gt;", "&lt;chunk&gt;\n&lt;info&gt;Devlog - Week 3: Debugging Data Loading Issues\nNote Path: Devlog.md\nAuthor: suhas&lt;/info&gt;\n\n### Week 3 - Debugging Data Loading Issues\n\n**Task: Efficient Data Loading**\n\nIn Week 3, I turned my attention to optimizing **data loading** and pipeline efficiency. Initially, the data loading process was slow, which was bottlenecking training speed. I realized that **data augmentation** operations, such as random resizing and horizontal flipping, were being applied on the CPU during the training loop, significantly slowing down the overall process.\n\n#### Solution:\n\nI optimized the data loading by using multi-threaded data loading and moving as much of the preprocessing as possible to the GPU. PyTorch\u2019s has a argument, which I increased to parallelize the data loading process across multiple CPU cores.\n\nBy increasing , I saw a noticeable boost in training speed. However, I had to balance this against GPU performance, as too many workers could lead to GPU starvation if not managed carefully.\n\n* * *\n&lt;/chunk&gt;", "&lt;chunk&gt;\n&lt;info&gt;Devlog - Week 4: Bug Tracking and Issue Resolution\nNote Path: Devlog.md\nAuthor: suhas&lt;/info&gt;\n\n### Week 4 - Bug Tracking and Issue Resolution\n\n**Task: Bug Tracking &amp;amp; Issue Resolution**\n\nBy Week 4, I was focusing on debugging several minor issues that arose during training and inference. The model occasionally produced **NaN (Not-a-Number)** values in the loss function during training, especially when using large learning rates. This issue was difficult to track because it only occurred intermittently, which suggested that it was related to exploding gradients in the Transformer component.\n\n#### Solution:\n\nI implemented **gradient clipping** to prevent the gradients from becoming too large and destabilizing the training process. By capping the gradient values, I was able to prevent NaNs from appearing in the loss function:\n\nAfter applying gradient clipping, the training became much more stable, and NaN values no longer appeared in the loss calculations. This allowed me to maintain a higher learning rate without destabilizing the training process.\n&lt;/chunk&gt;"]
