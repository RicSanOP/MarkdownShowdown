# What is Computer Vision?

Computer Vision is a subfield of Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence where humans teach computers to see and interpret the world around them. While humans and animals naturally solve vision as a problem from a very young age, helping machines interpret and perceive their surroundings via vision remains a largely unsolved problem. Limited perception of the human vision along with the infinitely varying scenery of our dynamic world is what makes Machine Vision complex at its core.
