# Object Detection Project

This project focuses on implementing and optimizing the **DETR (Detection Transformer)**, an end-to-end object detection model developed by Facebook Research. It leverages Transformer architecture, which is commonly used in natural language processing, to improve object detection by eliminating traditional object proposal methods. The goal is to fine-tune and deploy DETR, optimizing its performance for real-time and high-accuracy object detection tasks. The project will include dataset preparation, model training, hyperparameter tuning, performance optimization, and comprehensive documentation for deployment in production environments.
