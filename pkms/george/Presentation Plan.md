# Presentation Plan

Here is the structure of the presentation I will be giving to the CTO:
- **Introduction to the Project**  
  - Brief explanation of DETR (Detection Transformer).  
  - Importance of Transformers in object detection.  
  - Advantages of DETR over traditional methods.
- **Project Goals**  
  - Train and deploy DETR.  
  - Expected outcomes (benchmarking, fine-tuning, etc.).  
  - Use cases (e.g., autonomous systems).
- **Project Phases**  
  - **Phase 1:** Research and data preparation (dataset acquisition, preprocessing).  
  - **Phase 2:** Model fine-tuning and testing (benchmarking, tuning).  
  - **Phase 3:** Performance optimization (speed, memory).  
  - **Phase 4:** Documentation and delivery (user guide updates).
- **Team Structure and Responsibilities**  
  - Machine Learning Researcher: Model development, training.  
  - Software Engineer: Optimization, issue resolution.  
  - Technical Project Manager: Planning, oversight, documentation.
- **Challenges and Risks**  
  - Dataset limitations.  
  - Overfitting and model complexity.  
  - Infrastructure limitations (GPU availability).
- **Timeline and Milestones**  
  - Key milestones with estimated completion dates.  
  - Integration points.
- **Resources and Budget**  
  - Hardware (GPUs), datasets, software.  
  - Expected costs (infrastructure, training time).
- **Conclusion**  
  - Benefits of DETR for object detection.  
  - Enhancing our technological capabilities.
