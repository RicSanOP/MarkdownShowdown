| **Project Planning and Timeline Creation** | Develop a roadmap with milestones and deliverables for model improvements, feature additions, and evaluation plans.          | Technical Project Manager   |
| **Dependency Management**                  | Ensure that required libraries (PyTorch, torchvision, etc.) are correctly installed and update `requirements.txt` as needed. | Software Engineer           |
| **Data Preparation for Training**          | Download, structure, and preprocess COCO dataset for training and evaluation.                                                | Machine Learning Researcher |
| **Model Implementation**                   | Fine-tune or implement new Transformer-based models using DETRâ€™s architecture.                                               | Machine Learning Researcher |
| **Performance Optimization**               | Monitor and optimize GPU/CPU usage, training speed, and model inference time.                                                | Software Engineer           |
| **Documentation and Code Review**          | Oversee and review code quality, and ensure documentation for new features is clear.                                         | Technical Project Manager   |
| **Model Training**                         | Train DETR on different configurations (ResNet-50, ResNet-101) and fine-tune hyperparameters for optimal results.            | Machine Learning Researcher |
| **Bug Tracking & Issue Resolution**        | Track and resolve reported issues from users in the repository.                                                              | Software Engineer           |
| **Evaluation and Testing**                 | Evaluate trained models using COCO val dataset and create benchmarks.                                                        | Machine Learning Researcher |
| **User Guide Updates**                     | Write or update user guides based on new features or changes in the workflow.                                                | Technical Project Manager   |
