**Previous Meeting**: [[pkms/george/Meeting Notes Week 3]]
**Next Meeting**:
**Attendees:** Technical Project Manager, Software Engineer, Machine Learning Researcher

#### Discussion:

- **Technical Project Manager:**
	- Completed the evaluation criteria for model performance, focusing on COCO benchmarks.
	- Began preparing the final draft of the user guide updates.

- **Software Engineer:**
	- Optimized GPU usage by adjusting data prefetching and batch processing.
	- Next: Start performance testing on inference time and optimize Transformer layers.

- **Machine Learning Researcher:**
	- Completed initial training on ResNet-50; observed early convergence issues.
