## Challenges and Observations

1. **Model Overfitting and Convergence Stability**:
    - Teams often notice models converging too quickly and overfitting in early training stages. Validation performance may plateau unless learning rates are managed effectively.
    - **Observation Handling:** Initial high learning rates can lead to quicker convergence but risk overfitting. [[Gradient Clipping|gradient clipping]] was employed for stable losses.

2. **GPU Memory Limitations**:
    - Training large models like [[Convolutional Neural Network|ResNet-101]] can cause significant [[GPU Memory Constraints|GPU memory]] overheads, leading to out-of-memory errors with larger batch sizes.

3. **Data Loading Efficiency**:
    - Slow data loading processes can create training bottlenecks, especially when augmentation is carelessly offloaded onto the [[CPU|CPU]] during training.

4. **NaN Value Challenges**:
    - The occurrence of NaN values in loss calculations can result from exploding gradients in large models, making training unreliable.

## Resolution Strategies 

### Enhancements for GPU Memory Efficiency

- **Mixed Precision Training**: 
  - By employing [[PyTorch's AMP|mixed precision]], teams successfully reduced the memory footprint, allowing larger batch sizes without sacrificing memory efficiency.
  
- **Batch Size Adjustments**: 
  - Reducing sizes accommodated GPU capabilities while maintaining effective training size with [[Gradient Accumulation|gradient accumulation]].
  
### Training Stability and Overfitting Mitigation

- **Learning Rate and Scheduler**:
  - Weight decay and adaptable learning rates via [[Learning Rate Scheduling|schedulers]] help in maintaining convergence stability.
 
- **Gradient Clipping**:
  - Limitations on gradient sizes through [[Gradient Clipping]] were essential in stabilizing the training process and preventing NaN values.

### Efficient Data Loading

- **Multithreaded Data Loading**:
  - Enhancements such as increasing PyTorch's [[DataLoader `num_workers`|num_workers]] provided significant training speed boosts, balancing CPU and GPU workload.

### Bug Tracking and Issue Resolution

- **NaN Value Prevention**:
  - Early prevention through techniques like [[Gradient Clipping]] allowed higher learning rate usage without destabilizing the model.
