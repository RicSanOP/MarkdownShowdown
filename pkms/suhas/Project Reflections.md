# Project Reflections

This project has been a mix of interesting challenges and deep learning innovations. **DETR's architecture** is quite novel, blending **Transformers** with **CNNs** in a way that simplifies the object detection pipeline. While the architecture itself has been solid, managing the training process for a model of this complexity has involved overcoming several technical hurdles, particularly related to memory optimization and data handling.

In retrospect, I’ve learned the importance of **system optimization** in large-scale machine learning projects. Handling **GPU memory**, **data pipeline efficiency**, and **training stability** are critical aspects that can easily be overlooked in the initial design phases but can make or break the success of a model's deployment in production.

I’m excited to see how the final model will perform in real-world benchmarks and eager to dive deeper into **inference optimization** in the next phase of the project.
