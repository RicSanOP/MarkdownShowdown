# DETR Project Overview

The **DETR (Detection Transformer)** project focuses on implementing and fine-tuning a state-of-the-art object detection model that integrates **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** with **Transformers**. Developed by Facebook Research, DETR simplifies object detection by eliminating hand-crafted components like region proposal networks and post-processing steps, instead relying on Transformer-based attention mechanisms to detect objects directly.

#### Project Objectives:
- Train and fine-tune the DETR model on the **COCO dataset**.
- Optimize performance, focusing on memory efficiency, training speed, and accuracy.
- Deploy and evaluate the model against benchmarks to test real-world applicability.
### My Role: Software Engineer

As the **Software Engineer** on the project, my role revolves around the technical backbone of the model’s performance and efficiency. My key responsibilities include:

#### 1. Dependency and Environment Management
- Ensured that all dependencies (e.g., **PyTorch**, **torchvision**, **COCO API**) were correctly installed and version-compatible.
- Set up and managed the development environment using **Conda**, ensuring seamless setup across different platforms.
- Updated `requirements.txt` for ease of reproducibility and streamlined collaboration among team members.

#### 2. Performance Optimization
- Focused on **GPU/CPU optimization**, monitoring memory usage, and addressing training bottlenecks. This involved:
  - Reducing **GPU memory** usage by fine-tuning batch sizes and leveraging **mixed precision training** to balance performance with memory efficiency.
  - Optimized the data pipeline by multi-threading **data loading** using PyTorch's `DataLoader` and improving prefetching.

#### 3. Bug Tracking and Issue Resolution
- Debugged several training issues, including **NaN values** during backpropagation caused by exploding gradients, which I resolved through **gradient clipping**.
- Implemented fixes for GPU memory limitations during ResNet-101 training, including reducing batch sizes and enabling gradient accumulation to simulate larger batch sizes.

#### 4. Documentation and Collaboration
- Actively contributed to documenting code structure, especially around environment setup and performance improvements, ensuring that the project remains maintainable and accessible to team members.
- Worked closely with the **Machine Learning Researcher** to debug training issues and ensure that the model training ran smoothly, especially during hyperparameter tuning and fine-tuning stages.

#### Summary of My Role:

The software engineering aspect of the project involves balancing **performance optimization**, **infrastructure management**, and **debugging**, all while ensuring that the deep learning pipelines operate efficiently. The complexities of training **large Transformer models** like DETR on massive datasets such as COCO introduced various challenges, particularly around **memory and speed optimization**. My role has provided a deep dive into the intersection of **software engineering** and **machine learning**, which I’ve found both rewarding and challenging. Moving forward, I anticipate further refining the model's deployment for real-world applications, ensuring that it performs well both in terms of speed and accuracy.
