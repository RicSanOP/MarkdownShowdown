# LMMS Dataset

- We are going for a team building a computer vision project knowledge base
	- They are midway through and using the team base to stay aligned
	- It involves the development of a deep learning model
	- Must have lots of pictures
- There are 3 PKM that will be combined
	- Rifaat
		- the data and ML guy on the team
		- heavy linking
		- lots of questions and architecture charts
		- dataset and experiment considerations
	- Suhas
		- the super dev on the team
		- hacky note taking with little structure
		- devlog style
		- includes code blocks and guides
	- George
		- the TPM on the team
		- strict folder use and light linking
		- heavy task organization (tables and checklists)
		- meeting notes and sprint management
- Unifying identifiers
	- name the model and id parts of the codebase
	- mention names of members who are working on the project

## The CV Project
- I am going to use LLM to start designing the project


### Considerations
- Person A has a question that person B has the solution to
- Output is a website published Obsidian vault(s)
- Will use midjourney to generate various images for the notebases
